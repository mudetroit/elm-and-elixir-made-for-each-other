## Elixir
Elixir is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications.

"Elixir was designed with excellent and accessible tooling, documentation, and resources in mind." - Jos√© Valim <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


## Elixir
- Immutability
- Polymorphism via a mechanism called protocols.
- Support for documentation via Python-like docstrings in the Markdown formatting language
- Emphasis on recursion and higher-order functions instead of side-effect-based looping
- Lazy and async collections with streams
- Pattern matching
